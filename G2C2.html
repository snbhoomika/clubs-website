    To protect the environment and raise awareness of environmental issues. </b></i></p>
    <p>Youth is the backbone of our nation. A small step from the youth can bring a huge difference in fulfilling the vision of a clean and green India.
       Working progressively towards this goal, we have our own student run club, go green and clean club,G2C2 
       spreading every bit of ecological awareness and making a change in this world.</p>

<p>This student community was started back in 2014 by a bunch of ME CSE department students for a greener and cleaner UVCE. 
  Continuing to spread this enthusiasm are students from 2nd and 3rd year BE.
   Presently it is a huge group of about 100 voluntary members who are dedicated towards the cause to refurbish and
    restore the foliage of this heritage institution and our surrounding.
     Any organization is purposeless without a vision and mission.
      And the calling of this group stands in incorporating cleanliness and creating awareness among students to keep our 
    premises clean and to improve the collegeâ€™s aesthetic views with everyone's support.
